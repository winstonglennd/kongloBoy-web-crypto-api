This project integrates a public API into a capital fund company's website. Users can explore the company profile and view the latest data on the coins held by the company, with the option to refresh the page for updates.
The website utilizes EJS, CSS, and vanilla JS for the frontend, along with Express and Axios for the backend.
Check out the website which is deployed using vercel: https://kongloboy-capital.vercel.app/
